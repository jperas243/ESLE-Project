A Cloud-native Online Boutique
This example demonstrates the deployments of a cloud-native web-based e-commerce Online
Boutique, consisting of a 10-tier microservices application where users can browse items, add them to a cart,
and purchase them.
The application works on any Kubernetes cluster, even locally in a personal computer.
