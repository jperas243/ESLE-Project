For the first stage of the project students are expected to:

- [x] Containerize the system using Docker and Docker Swarm. Students are free to
use Kubernetes, Apache Mesos or other alternative orchestration platforms.
- [x] Devise a simple benchmark that allows to assess the behaviour of the system.

- [ ] Analyse the scalability properties of the system.
- [ ] Analyse how the scalability properties can be explained considering the
Universal Scalability Law.

- [ ] Decompose a request into a pipeline of stages.
- [ ] Study which portions of the pipeline are the bottleneck (or can become one) and
reason about which of the techniques studied in the classes could be applied
to remove or mitigate the bottleneck.

i) the structure of the repository


ii) how to run a small demo of the system with a few clients and
servers.
