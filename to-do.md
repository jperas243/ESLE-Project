Design and describe the evaluation process of the system under test, namely:
- [ ] Identify and describe the system and workload parameters.
- [ ] Design an experiment that allows to efficiently assess the effect of the different
factors and levels. The experiment should consider at least 6 factors at two levels
each.
- [ ] Select, and justify, the metrics, factors and levels used in the experimental design.
- [ ] Discuss and justify the experimental design (sign table) and the obtained results.
- [ ] Select one of the factors with the most effect and analyse the scalability properties
of the system. Discuss the different portions that limit the scalability of the system
under test according to the USL.
